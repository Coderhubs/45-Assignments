//Question 22: Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. 
//Correct the error before finishing.
let friends = ["Herry", "Kim", "Daud", "Jack"];
console.log(friends[5]); // Intentional index error
friends[2] = "Daud"; // correct index error
export {};
// This result is shown undefined because i mentioned in line 2 and I print the index which was out of Array bound,
// thats why its shows undefined, while if In line 6 If i add console log so it will print the name daud in terminal.
// just share my concept as a beginner
